## Gabriel R. F. Lopes
<sub>*Data Scientist and MsC. in Physics*</sub>

As a experienced physics researcher, I conducted experiments that required a lot of data analysis and visualization. I worked to transform information into knowledge in physics through an understanding of variables and concepts using data.

Now I study Data Science to use this knowledge to help businesses and people in general who need this kind of data treatment. I'm specializing in data analysis and visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, among other libraries.

My codes are very organized and follow the principles of data storytelling, for better understanding and hierarchization of the information presented. I'm also studying Machine Learning applications on data science.

My credentials include a Master's in Physics from the Federal University of Itajuba (UNIFEI), an institution of higher education and advanced research rated among the best engineering schools in Brazil. There I worked with the electrical characterization of semiconductors, applied to sensors and optoelectronic devices.

**Background in:** Python, Machine Learning, Semiconductor Technology, Physics.
